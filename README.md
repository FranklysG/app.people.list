##### Project run :

##### Run tests

#### Obs: 
- The application was developed using NextJS with Tailwindcss for styling and animation
- The `react-toastfy` library was used to give the user responses, such as success and error
- The tests were done using the `cypress` library
- To make all the requests, we use the `axios` lib
- Finally, to manage the application of states, we use the `Context API` of `React` itself
